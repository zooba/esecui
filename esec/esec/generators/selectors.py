'''A set of selector generators that return some or all of a group of
individuals without modification.

These are distinct from `esec.generators.filters` because they typically
compare individuals against each other (as in ``Best`` or ``Yougest``
selectors). Selectors usually cannot operate on unbounded groups.

The global variable ``rand`` is made available through the context in
which the selectors are executed.

    :Parameters:
      _source : iterable(`Individual`)
        A sequence of individuals. Some or all individuals are returned
        from this sequence, depending on the selection criteria.
      
      replacement : bool
        For backwards compatibility. Use either `with_replacement` or
        `without_replacement`.
      
      with_replacement : bool
        ``False`` to remove individuals from contention once they have
        been returned. The generator terminates when no individuals
        remain and the total number of individuals is equal to the
        number in `_source`. If ``True``, the generator will never
        terminate.
        
        If both `with_replacement` and `without_replacement` are
        ``False``, `with_replacement` is the default.
        
        If `sus` is ``True``, replacement is ignored.
      
      without_replacement : bool
        ``True`` to remove individuals from contention once they have
        been returned.
        
        If both `with_replacement` and `without_replacement` are
        ``False``, `with_replacement` is the default.
        
        If `sus` is ``True``, replacement is ignored.
      
      expectation : float |isin| [1.0, 2.0]
        The relative probability of selecting the highest ranked
        individual. Defaults to 1.1.
        
        If `neta` is provided, its value is used instead.
      
      neta : float
        A synonym for `expectation`.
      
      invert : bool [optional]
        ``False`` to give the highest probabilities to the most fit
        individuals; otherwise, ``True`` to give the highest
        probabilities to the least fit individuals.
      
      sus : bool
        ``True`` to use stochastic universal sampling (SUS). SUS equally
        spaces selections based on `mu`, resulting in a wider sample
        distribution.
        
        If `sus` is ``True``, replacement is ignored.
      
      mu : int [optional]
        The number of selections being made when using SUS. If not
        provided, the total number of individuals in `_source` is used.
        
        If `sus` is ``False``, `mu` is ignored.
