'''A species for joined individuals.

Joined individuals do not support standard mutation operations. Standard
recombination operations are available, though should be used with care.

The `JoinedSpecies.crossover_tuple` operation is specifically designed
for joined individuals.

            The probability of any particular group of individuals being

            individual in the joined individual is returned unmodified.
